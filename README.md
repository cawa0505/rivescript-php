This is a RiveScript interpreter library for PHP. RiveScript is a simple scripting language for chatbots with a friendly, easy to learn syntax.

The package follows the FIG standards PSR-1, PSR-2, and PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code.

## Quick Installation
Simply install the package through Composer.

```
composer require axiom/rivescript
```

## Integration
The RiveScript PHP interpreter is framework agnostic. As such, the interpreter can be used as is with native PHP, or with your favorite framework.

# Working Draft

The RiveScript Working Draft (WD) is a document that defines the standards for how RiveScript should work, from an implementation-agnostic point of view. The Working Draft should be followed when contributing to the RiveScript-PHP interpreter. If any of the current implementations don't do what the Working Draft says they should, this is considered to be a bug and you can file a bug report or send a pull request.
